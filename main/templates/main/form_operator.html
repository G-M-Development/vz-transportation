      <h2>Rules and regulations</h2>
      <p>
        1. In connection with your application for employment with (“Prospective Employer”), Prospective Employer, its
        employees, agents or contractors may obtain one or more reports regarding your driving, and safety inspection
        history from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).When the application for employment is
        submitted in person, if the Prospective Employer uses any information it obtains from FMCSA in a decision to not
        hire you or to make any other adverse employment decision regarding you, the Prospective Employer will provide
        you with a copy of the report upon which its decision was based and a written summary of your rights under the
        Fair Credit Reporting Act before taking any final adverse action. If any final adverse action is taken against
        you based upon your driving history or safety report, the Prospective Employer will notify you that the action
        has been taken and that the action was based in part or in whole on this report. When the application for
        employment is submitted by mail, telephone, computer, or other similar means, if the Prospective Employer uses
        any information it obtains from FMCSA in a decision to not hire you or to make any other adverse employment
        decision regarding you, the Prospective Employer must provide you within three business days of taking adverse
        action oral, written or electronic notification: that adverse action has been taken based in whole or in part on
        information obtained from FMCSA; the name, address, and the toll free telephone number of FMCSA; that the FMCSA
        did not make the decision to take the adverse action and is unable to provide you the specific reasons why the
        adverse action was taken; and that you may, upon providing proper identification, request a free copy of the
        report and may dispute with the FMCSA the accuracy or completeness of any information or report. If you request
        a copy of a driver record from the Prospective Employer who procured the report, then, within 3 business days of
        receiving your request, together with proper identification, the Prospective Employer must send or provide to
        you a copy of your report and a summary of your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The Prospective
        Employer cannot obtain background reports from FMCSA unless you consent in writing. If you agree that the
        Prospective Employer may obtain such background reports, please read the following and sign below: 2. I
        authorize(“Prospective Employer”) to access the FMCSA Pre-Employment Screening Program (PSP) system to seek
        information regarding my commercial driving safety record and information regarding my safety inspection
        history. I understand that I am consenting to the release of safety performance information including crash data
        from the previous five (5) years and inspection history from the previous three (3) years. I understand and
        acknowledge that this release of information may assist the Prospective Employer to make a determination
        regarding my suitability as an employee. 3. I further understand that neither the Prospective Employer nor the
        FMCSA contractor supplying the crash and safety information has the capability to correct any safety data that
        appears to be incorrect. I understand I may challenge the accuracy of the data by submitting a request to
        https://dataqs.fmcsa.dot.gov. If I am challenging crash or inspection information reported by a State, FMCSA
        cannot change or correct this data. I understand my request will be forwarded by the DataQs system to the
        appropriate State for adjudication. 4. Please note: Any crash or inspection in which you were involved will
        display on your PSP report. Since the PSP report does not report, or assign, or imply fault, it will include all
        Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) crashes where you were a driver or co-driver and where those crashes were
        reported to FMCSA, regardless of fault. Similarly, all inspections, with or without violations, appear on the
        PSP report. State citations associated with FMCSR violations that have been adjudicated by a court of law will
        also appear, and remain, on a PSP report. I have read the above Notice Regarding Background Reports provided to
        me by Prospective Employer and I understand that if I sign this consent form, Prospective Employer may obtain a
        report of my crash and inspection history. I hereby authorize Prospective Employer and its employees, authorized
        agents, and/or affiliates to obtain the information authorized above. NOTICE: This form is made available to
        monthly account holders by NICT on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety
        Administration (FMCSA). Account holders are required by federal law to obtain an Applicant’s written or
        electronic consent prior to accessing the Applicant’s PSP report. Further, account holders are required by FMCSA
        to use the language provided in paragraphs 1-4 of this document to obtain a prospective Applicant’s consent. The
        language must be used in whole, exactly as provided. The language may be included with other consent forms or
        language at the discretion of the account holder, provided the four paragraphs remain intact and the language is
        unchanged.
